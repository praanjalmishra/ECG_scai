Coding task:

Create an environment (e.g., conda, docker) and directory tree where one could perform the following tasks:

    -Load the files on the data folder
    -Extract the following data files:
        timestamp
        hear rate: HR
        respiratory rate: RR
        Acceleration: acc
        ECG: PR, QRS, QT
    -Perform an analysis of the current data which you consider useful for understanding it and explain your approach 
    (e.g., Heart rate variability, Heart rate per hour over the day, or actigraphy).
    -Find correlation coefficients between data fields over time-windows over the day (e.g. day time vs. night time or hourly)
    -Perform unsupervised data clustering over the HR and RR data and visualize the results.

Considerations for your code and our discussion. Imagine that what I am sending is a set of files for a single device and a single person, 
but consider the code to be useful if: 1. you have 200 people 2. You have 10 devices producing similar data structures 3. You have these data per day for 30 days
